You may check the font path of the running server by typing the command

    $ xset q


2.2.4.1. Temporary modification of the font path

The `xset' utility may be used to modify the font path for the current session. The font path is set with the command xset fp; a new element is added to the front with xset +fp, and added to the end with xset fp+. For example,

    $ xset +fp /usr/local/fonts/Type1
        $ xset fp+ /usr/local/fonts/bitmap

	Conversely, an element may be removed from the front of the font path with `xset -fp', and removed from the end with `xset fp-'. You may reset the font path to its default value with `xset fp default'.

	For more information, please consult the xset(1) manual page.
